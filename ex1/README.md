# Exercise 01 - Sort an array manually

Welcome to the first exercise of the series!

The goal here is to sort a given array (`grades`, in this case) ..._manually_.

### Rules
- You can't use a pre-existing sorting function;
- You can't use a sorting algorithm;
- You have to find another way to sort this array (it doesn't need to be efficient);
- You can use up to one additional arrays in order to solve this;
- You only have to implement the `sortArray` function.

Good luck, and have fun!
